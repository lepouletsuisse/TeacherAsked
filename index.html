      <p>This app will allow a teacher (that has been logged before) to create a room with a ID and to give it to his students. The students can connect to the room with a given username and once the students are in the room, the teacher can asked a question that will be display to all the student. He can answer to the question with his fields. Before the teacher close the question, the student can't see other's responses. The teacher can always see all the responses in real time but can also choose to hide them for the moment (If his screen is displaying in front of the class for exemple). When the teacher decide to close the question, some statistics will be display to him and to all his students and he can create a new question.
